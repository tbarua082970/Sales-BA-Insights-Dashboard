# Sales & Profitability Business Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a mid-level Business Analyst approach to analyzing sales performance, profitability drivers, and customer and regional insights using Power BI.

The dashboard focuses on answering key business questions such as:
- Where is revenue growing or declining year-over-year?
- Which products and customers generate profit versus volume?
- Which regions contribute most to overall performance?
- Where are margin risks and optimization opportunities?

## What Was Done in This Project

### 1. Data Preparation & Modeling
- Loaded transactional and master data from CSV and Excel sources.
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query.
- Designed a star-schema data model with Fact and Dimension tables.
- Established one-to-many relationships for accurate aggregation.
- Configured a proper Date table to enable time intelligence.

### 2. Business Metrics & DAX
Created reusable DAX measures to support analysis, including:
- Total Sales

## Notes
This project reflects a real-world Business Analyst workflow where insights are derived through structured data modeling, DAX calculations, and decision-oriented dashboards rather than basic reporting.
